        JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. According to a recent survey conducted by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the most popular language on earth.
        With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the server with Node.js and other frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more.
